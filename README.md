# Linguistics
Hello! This is my first attempt of linguistic analysis using Natural Language Toolkit (nltk). 

In this project, I used Python to scrape text from a webpage and perform various linguistic analyses. Using requests and BeautifulSoup, I extracted the text, then tokenized and tagged it with parts of speech using the nltk library. I analyzed the frequency of POS tags, word lengths, and specific words. Additionally, I examined the usage of past continuous tense in the text. Finally, I visualized the results with matplotlib.
